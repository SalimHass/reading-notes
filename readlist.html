  <h1>Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>The big O in any algorithm is to describe worst case scenario of the performance , the performance related to Time and Space. There are 4 key areas to analyze: </p>
  <p>1- Input size <br> 
  2-Unit of measurment <br>
  3- Orders of growth<br>
  4-Best case, Worst case and Average case</p>

<h4>Input size</h4>
<p>
    Input Size refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm.its not just the number of parameters , it takes in consideration the size of each parameter value.<br>
    We will use the (n) to refer to the input size.

</p>
<h4>Units of Measurement</h4>

<p>
 We need to quantify our measurement of time , to do that we should take in mind three aspects of time:<br>
 1-The time in milliseconds from the start of a function execution until it ends.<br>
 2-The number of operations that are executed.<br>
 3-The number of “Basic Operations” that are executed. <br>
 In order to quantify memory space , we need to take in consideration four sources of memory usage during function time-run:
1-The amount of space needed to hold the code for the algorithm.<br>
2-The amount of space needed to hold the input data.<br>
3-The amount of space needed for the output data.
4-The amount of space needed to hold working space during the calculation. 
   
</p>
<h4>Order of Growth</h4>
<p>We describe the order of the efficiency by referring to the input size in and measure the time and space required to execute the code for n input .<br>

  <h2>Linked Lists</h2>
  <p>A linked list is a sequence of Nodes that are connected to each other . The defining feature of linked lists is that each Node references the next Node in the link.</p>
  <h4>Terminology:</h4>
  <p>
      1- linked list : A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.<br>
      2- Singly: the number of references the node has, this means there is one reference. The reference refers to the next node.<br>
      3-Doubly : This means there are two references within the node. and it means that there is a reference to both the next and previous node.<br>
      4-Node : Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.<br>
      5-Next : Each node contains a property called Next ,This property contains the reference to the next node.<br>
      6-Head : a reference of type Node to the first Node in a linked list.<br>
      7-Current : The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
