<h2>SQL</h2>
<p>I have not worked a lot with SQL , and I didn’t have much time to work with enough to be able to digest properly , I liked its concept and its applications , and I hope I can work with adequately  to master. Here are some of the commands I got from the SQLBolt which we are required to finish in this course.</p> 
<p>Select :  we can use select in this form SELECT column, columnx    FROM table_name   to select from column  and columnx or we can use * to pick all .</p>
<p>Where : we can it in this form SELECT column FROM movies where condition ;  condition might be any entry that we need to match , we can use conditions in the type of between x and y .  and we can add not to reverse  the condition. Or we can logical signs such as < and >.</p>
<p>Distinct: use distinct to remove duplicate in rows , and we use it in this from  SELECT DISTINCT column,columnx    FROM table_name  WHERE conditions .  you can add ORDER BY column ASC\DESC to order the column ascending or descending . </p>
<p>Limit and Offset : you can use limit and offset to set a limit for the data and an offset from the start, it is used in this form after the LIMIT x OFFSET y; to set the limit to x elements and to start after y entry .</p>
<p>JOIN and INNER JOIN : to get results from two tables that share information about single entry and its used in this from SELECT column, columnx    FROM Table  JOIN Tablex    ON table.id = tablex.idx; and we can add any condition and order after that . </p>
<p>Insert: to insert a row into the table, it’s used in this form INSERT INTO table VALUES (v1,v2,v3 …);</p>
<p>Update : its used to update an entry , its used in this from UPDATE table SET column = value WHERE  condition ;</p>
<p>Delete : its used to delete and entry (a row), its use din this from DELETE FROM table where condition ;</p>
<p>Create: use create to create a database, its used in this form CREATE TABLE tablename ( column1 datatype, column2 datatype, …  );</p>
<p>Drop: to delete the whole table , its used in this form DROP TABLE tablename;</p>
