<h1>The Growth Mindset</h1>
<p>To get better you have to challenge yourself, redoing the same tasks every time will not make you any better , you have to get out of your comfort zone ,  </p>
<p>this is where your growth begins , as a programmer , you can not do the exact program everyday and expect to get better , you need to find yourself some </p>
<p>challenging tasks to push you forward and make you learn new things. The Matasano Crypto Challenges site can help you find your next chellenage. </p>

<p>In her studies dr. Dweck , introduced the principle of not yet , which means that you didn not realy faild a task , it just you are not there yet , and she clams  </p>
<p>That there are two types of mind sets, , growth mind-set and fixed mind-set, the difference is that  in those who has the growth mentality will be able to show more</p>
<p>effort to achieve something . alas her principle is criticized as its hard to duplicate the results , and when GRIT where applied , to her data set it  found inconsistencies.*</p>
 
<p>Duckworth , started to use Grit as a predictor of success , grit means passion and perseverance for very long-term goals , and it is about having stamina for years, and working</p>

<p>on grit would lead to the neglect of other important factors, like the positive socio-economic prerequisites necessary to deploy it.* , and this means neither Dr Dweck nor Duckworth </p>
<p>provided solid well established researches.</p>
